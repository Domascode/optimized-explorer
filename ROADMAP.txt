Optimized File System Explorer - Enhancement Roadmap
=============================================

Phase 1: Advanced Search
-----------------------
1. Content Search
   - Implement grep-like text search within files
   - Add binary file pattern matching
   - Support multiple search patterns
   - Add context lines option
   - Implement parallel search for large files

2. Smart Filtering
   - Search by file size ranges
   - Search by date ranges (created, modified, accessed)
   - Filter by file types/extensions
   - Regular expression support for names
   - Attribute-based filtering (hidden, system, readonly)

3. Search Management
   - Save search patterns/queries
   - Search history
   - Export search results (CSV, JSON)
   - Configurable search depth
   - Exclude patterns/directories

Phase 2: Enhanced Operations
---------------------------
1. Batch Processing
   - Multiple file selection (patterns, ranges)
   - Bulk rename with patterns
   - Mass file operations (copy, move, delete)
   - Operation preview before execution
   - Progress tracking for large operations

2. File Analysis
   - Calculate directory sizes
   - Find duplicate files
   - Generate file checksums (MD5, SHA)
   - Basic file type detection
   - File integrity verification
   - Disk space analysis and visualization

3. Compression Support
   - Zip/unzip files and directories
   - Support multiple compression formats
   - Password protection
   - Split large archives
   - Compression ratio optimization

Phase 3: Smart Features
----------------------
1. File Preview
   - Text file preview with syntax highlighting
   - Image thumbnail generation
   - Basic media file information
   - File metadata display
   - Quick content peek

2. Directory Monitoring
   - Watch directories for changes
   - Real-time notifications
   - Change logging
   - Auto-refresh on changes
   - Event filtering

3. History and Bookmarks
   - Operation history
   - Undo/redo support
   - Directory bookmarks
   - Frequently used locations
   - Quick access shortcuts

Phase 4: User Experience
-----------------------
1. Interface Improvements
   - Color coding for different file types
   - Progress bars for operations
   - Status line with system information
   - Dynamic prompt with git status
   - Tab completion for paths

2. Configuration System
   - User preferences file
   - Customizable colors and formats
   - Alias support for commands
   - Plugin system for extensions
   - Custom command scripts

3. Integration Features
   - Version control system integration (git)
   - Cloud storage support
   - Network share handling
   - External tool integration
   - Shell command passthrough

Phase 5: Performance & Security
-----------------------------
1. Performance Optimization
   - Parallel processing for operations
   - Cached directory listings
   - Memory usage optimization
   - Lazy loading for large directories
   - Index frequently accessed paths

2. Security Features
   - File encryption/decryption
   - Secure deletion option
   - Permission management
   - Access logging
   - Backup/restore functionality

3. Resource Management
   - Disk space monitoring
   - Resource usage limits
   - Operation quotas
   - Auto-cleanup options
   - System resource awareness

Implementation Priority
----------------------
High Priority (Immediate Impact):
1. Content search with grep functionality
2. Batch file operations
3. Directory size calculation
4. File preview capability
5. Directory bookmarks

Medium Priority (Enhanced Functionality):
1. Compression support
2. Duplicate file finder
3. Directory monitoring
4. Configuration system
5. Tab completion

Low Priority (Nice to Have):
1. Cloud integration
2. Plugin system
3. Advanced encryption
4. Custom scripting
5. Network features

Technical Requirements
---------------------
1. Additional Libraries:
   - libmagic for file type detection
   - zlib for compression
   - openssl for encryption
   - pcre for regex
   - rapidjson for configuration

2. System Requirements:
   - C++17 or later
   - Multi-threading support
   - File system monitoring capabilities
   - Sufficient permissions for operations

3. Development Tools:
   - CMake build system
   - Git for version control
   - Unit testing framework
   - Static code analysis
   - Performance profiling tools

This roadmap represents a path to transform the basic file explorer into a
powerful system administration and file management tool. Each phase builds
upon the previous ones, gradually adding more sophisticated features while
maintaining the core simplicity and reliability of the original design.
